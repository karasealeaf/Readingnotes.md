# Reading notes

## Kara Sealeaf
Hi, my name is Kara, I am 33 years old and from Liverpool. I have just moved back to Liverpool from the Lake district and live with my boyfriend, our son and puppy Reginald (or bear). These are my reading notes from all of the classes I have attended.

I was recently self-employed looking after properties and maintaining them, however, I would like to change my career and become a software engineer, as I love creating and designing.
